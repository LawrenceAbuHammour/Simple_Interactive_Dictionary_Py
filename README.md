# Simple_Interactive_Dictionary_Py

Using the Python programming language, I was able to program a command-line terminal dictionary which accepts user-input and interprets the word that the user is searching the definition of and matches it with the keys of a provided *.json file. Please make sure to download the data.json file and the DictionaryFinal.py file together. Published in July 2018.
